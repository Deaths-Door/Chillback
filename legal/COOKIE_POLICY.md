## Cookie Policy of Chillback

This document informs Users about the technologies that help this Application to achieve the purposes described below. Such technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a script) on a User’s device as they interact with this Application.

For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as "Trackers" within this document – unless there is a reason to differentiate.
For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.

Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User's consent. Whenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.

This Application only uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called “first-party” Trackers).
The validity and expiration periods of first-party Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by the Owner. Some of them expire upon termination of the User’s browsing session.

### Activities strictly necessary for the operation of this Application and delivery of the Service

This Application uses so-called “technical” Cookies and other similar Trackers to carry out activities that are strictly necessary for the operation or delivery of the Service.

### Other activities involving the use of Trackers

#### Marketing

This Application uses Trackers to deliver personalized marketing content based on User behavior and to operate, serve and track ads.

Some of the advertising services used by the Owner adhere to the [IAB Transparency and Consent Framework](https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/), an initiative that facilitates responsible privacy practices across the digital advertising industry - providing Users with enhanced transparency and control over how their data are used for advertising tracking purposes. Users can customize their advertising preferences at any time by accessing the advertising preferences panel from within the cookie notice or via the relevant link on this Application.

This Application participates in the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework and complies with its Specifications and Policies. This Application uses iubenda (identification number 123) as a Consent Management Platform.

### How to manage preferences

There are various ways to manage Tracker related preferences:

Users can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly within their own device settings, for example, by preventing the use or storage of Trackers.

Additionally Users can set their preferences within the cookie notice or by updating such preferences accordingly via the relevant consent-preferences privacy widget, if available.

It is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to delete previously stored Trackers, including those used to remember the User’s initial consent preferences.

Other Trackers in the browser’s local memory may be cleared by deleting the browsing history.

#### Locating Tracker Settings

Users can, for example, find information about how to manage Cookies in the most commonly used browsers at the following addresses:

* [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en&p=cpn_cookies)
* [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences)
* [Apple Safari](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/manage-cookies-and-website-data-sfri11471/)
* [Microsoft Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/block-or-allow-cookies)
* [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027947)
* [Brave](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022806212-How-do-I-use-Shields-while-browsing)
* [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies)

Users may also manage certain categories of Trackers used on mobile apps by opting out through relevant device settings such as the device advertising settings for mobile devices, or tracking settings in general (Users may open the device settings and look for the relevant setting).

#### How to opt out of interest-based advertising

Notwithstanding the above, Users may follow the instructions provided by [YourOnlineChoices](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) (EU and UK), the [Network Advertising Initiative](https://thenai.org/about-online-advertising/) (US) and the [Digital Advertising Alliance](https://www.aboutads.info/consumers/) (US), [DAAC](https://youradchoices.ca/understanding-online-advertising/) (Canada), [DDAI](http://www.ddai.info/optout) (Japan) or other similar services. Such initiatives allow Users to select their tracking preferences for most of the advertising tools. The Owner thus recommends that Users make use of these resources in addition to the information provided in this document.

The Digital Advertising Alliance offers an application called [AppChoices](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices) that helps Users to control interest-based advertising on mobile apps.

#### Consequences of denying the use of Trackers

Users are free to decide whether or not to allow the use of Trackers. However, please note that Trackers help this Application to provide a better experience and advanced functionalities to Users (in line with the purposes outlined in this document). Therefore, if the User chooses to block the use of Trackers, the Owner may be unable to provide related features.
